Fine-Tuning GPT-2 for a Custom Q&A Chatbot

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune GPT-2, a powerful language model developed by OpenAI, on a custom Question–Answer dataset to build an intelligent chatbot. The chatbot learns from your dataset and can generate context-aware responses to user queries.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a conversational AI model that mimics human-like responses for domain-specific or general Q&A tasks.
The workflow involves:-
Preparing a dataset of question–answer pairs.
Fine-tuning the GPT-2 model using the Hugging Face transformers library.
Saving and testing the trained chatbot to generate responses interactively.

Future Enhancements

Integrate a web interface using Streamlit or Gradio
Expand dataset for multi-turn conversations
Deploy chatbot via Hugging Face Spaces or Flask API
Add model evaluation metrics (e.g., perplexity)
Implement memory or context retention between chat turns

Technologies Used

Python 
Hugging Face Transformers 
PyTorch 
Pandas, NumPy
Jupyter / Google Colab
